1. The behaviour of these two examples are identical. Because in first case "rst_counter" drived by logical "1" in STATE_1 and in second case "next_rst_counter" drived by logical "1" in STATE_0, but with next posedge clock signal this "rst_counter" will be changed by logical "1" in STATE_1 too.

2. Look figure.

3.Because combinational logic which FSM needs for swiching own states very simple and few increase with increasing number of states. (Look answer 2)

4. One most benefit of registered outputs FSM is non-availability of additional combinational logic which in turn increases delay.

5. Adding either or both "// synopsys full_case parallel_case" directives to the Verilog FSM source code is generally beneficial when coding one-hot or one-hot with zero-idle FSMs. In these cases,it is given that only one bit of the state vector is set and that all other bit-pattern combinationsshould be treated as "don't cares." It is also given that there should be no overlap in the list of case items
